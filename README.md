# Subset Generation for Client Scheduling in Federated Learning
This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook [Stage 2 Scheduling - Subset Generation.ipynb] that implements Algorithm 1 (Generate Subsets) of the paper "Ensuring Fairness in Federated Learning Services: Innovative Approaches to Client Selection, Scheduling, and Rewards" to be included in the IEEE ICDCS 2024 conference. 

The code uses IBM CPLEX (https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) to solve multidimensional knapsack problems (MKP). 

In the Experiment session, subsets generated by Algorithm 1 and subsets generated by random selection are shown in the form of data distribution over labels. 

This code can be integrated with any basic federated learning algorithm to perform per-round client scheduling as described in the paper.
